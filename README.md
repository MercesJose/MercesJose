I am autistic and have a lot of difficulty relating to people in general, but I am able to develop lasting friendships with those who are close to me. I am married and have three children. I currently live in Cascais, Portugal. I have technical training in Mechatronics and Electrotechnics. I also have a degree in Industrial Electronics and Engineering in Automation and Control.

I always wanted to learn electronics and consequently I became a professional in the field. I like having fun with my family and thinking about things I never thought of.

When starting the network specialist course in 2021, I became more comfortable with Linux and I wanted to contribute with my knowledge

I recently took a course at Softblue on Java Master Developer Training and learned the concepts from basic to advanced Back End Developer using Java and Android. I also learned Front End Developer, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and as I had a good understanding of C, Delphi, Visual Basic, VisualC#, Android, Java and labview in the two upper formations, it was easy to see its application in webs and desktop systems .

I also recently took some Altium Designer and SolidWorks courses to improve my skills at SKA, a company specializing in Altium Designer and SolidWorks

I'm one of the unprofessionals who manages to seamlessly tie hardware and software together in every aspect. During my career of more than 16 years of experiences, I have always been involved with Back End Developer and Front End Developer to test the prototypes that I developed and also, I always designed the shells in 3Ds. That way I never needed or depended on IT and CADCAM professionals for my solutions or Electronic Projects.

I am able to develop with precision and performance, any project, be it electronics or IT, using the concepts of analog and digital electronics, instrumentation and control together with Back End Developer and Front End Developer.

I love challenges because with it I can develop new skills. An example of this I found at WISEHOME where I needed to create an electronic board to control inductive and resistive loads inside a 4X2 box, standard Brazilian. WiserHome asked me for a project that would allow people around the world to efficiently and safely control lighting and electrically connected devices in a totally innovative, absolutely safe and socially-environmental way, extremely accessible to all social classes.

With that in mind, I developed a board that is connected to the house's existing switch or outlet inside the 4X2 box, so that the resident can control the lights and even control his audio and video system and the electric gate through an application mobile or using existing switches in your home.
